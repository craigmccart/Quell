# Quell - Working Status

Living tracker of where Quell is, what's landed, and what's next. Update after every session that changes state. Sits alongside `POSITIONING.md` (strategy) and `FIX_PROMPTS/` (concrete next actions).

*Last updated: 2026-04-23 (round 9 landed: v2.7.0 with 5 new AI-provider patterns, pattern hygiene, themed sidebar icon, 78/78 tests, ready to publish)*

## Snapshot

- **Repo**: `C:\\Users\\craig\\Github Repos\\Quell`, single checkout on `main`
- **Publisher**: `Sonofg0tham`
- **Version in repo**: v2.7.0 (not yet published — v2.5.1 is live on marketplace; v2.6.0 exists as CHANGELOG entry only, superseded by v2.7.0)
- **Licence**: MIT
- **Adoption (as of 2026-04-09)**: OpenVSX 484 downloads / 7 installs, VSCode Marketplace 65 acquisitions in last 30 days
- **Tests**: 78/78 passing
- **Working tree**: clean, up to date with origin/main

## Workflow rules for this project

- Craig is a vibe coder. Cowork session (Sonnet) reads the codebase, identifies improvements, writes comprehensive prompt docs Craig pastes into Claude Code. Claude Code does all edits, compile/test verification, commit, and push. No sandbox edits unless Craig specifically requests them.
- Sandbox cannot push. Sandbox cannot delete files on the mounted Windows filesystem.
- Work from the single `main` checkout. No worktrees.
- Jules agent is active on the repo and may land PRs between sessions — always check `git log` first.

## Future release process

With `.github/workflows/release.yml` in place, future versions work like this:

1. Bump version in `package.json` + update `CHANGELOG.md`
2. Commit and push to main
3. Push a tag: `git tag v2.6.0 && git push origin v2.6.0`
4. GitHub Actions builds `quell-2.6.0.vsix` and attaches it to a GitHub Release automatically
5. Download the VSIX from the release, upload to VS Code Marketplace manually
6. Run `npx ovsx publish quell-2.6.0.vsix -p <token>` for OpenVSX

## What's next

### Publish v2.7.0

1. Tag the release: `git tag v2.7.0 && git push origin v2.7.0`
2. GitHub Actions builds `quell-2.7.0.vsix` and attaches it to a GitHub Release automatically
3. Download VSIX from the GitHub Release page
4. Upload to VS Code Marketplace (manual)
5. `npx ovsx publish quell-2.7.0.vsix -p <token>` for OpenVSX

Note: v2.6.0 was never tagged/published — v2.7.0 supersedes it. CHANGELOG retains the v2.6.0 entry for historical record.

### Pending
- **npm (@sonofg0tham/quell-scanner)** — `cd packages/scanner && npm run build && npm publish` (needs `npm login --auth-type=web` as Sonofg0tham first). Verify at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sonofg0tham/quell-scanner
- PostgreSQL double-detection confirmed as non-issue (same-value dedup works correctly)

### Post-launch
- Launch post (Product Hunt / HN / LinkedIn/Twitter)
- Monitor adoption numbers, respond to issues
- Explore monetisation surfaces: team pattern packs, CI integration (uses @sonofg0tham/quell-scanner npm package)
