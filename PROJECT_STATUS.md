Living tracker of where Quell is, what's landed, and what's next. Update after every session that changes state. Sits alongside `POSITIONING.md` (strategy) and `FIX_PROMPTS/` (concrete next actions).

## Workflow rules for this project

- Craig is a vibe coder. Cowork session (Sonnet) reads the codebase, identifies improvements, writes comprehensive prompt docs Craig pastes into Claude Code. Claude Code does all edits, compile/test verification, commit, and push. No sandbox edits unless Craig specifically requests them.
- Sandbox cannot push. Sandbox cannot delete files on the mounted Windows filesystem.
- Work from the single `main` checkout. No worktrees.
- Jules agent is active on the repo and may land PRs between sessions — always check `git log` first.

## What's next

### Immediate publish steps (manual — do in order)

1. **Build VSIX** — from repo root: `npx vsce package` → produces `quell-2.5.0.vsix`
2. **VS Code Marketplace** — https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/Sonofg0tham → Quell → Update → upload VSIX. Verify at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Sonofg0tham.quell
3. **OpenVSX** — `npx ovsx publish quell-2.5.0.vsix -p <token>` (token at https://open-vsx.org/user-settings/tokens). Verify at https://open-vsx.org/extension/Sonofg0tham/quell
4. **npm (@quell/scanner)** — `cd packages/scanner && npm run build && npm publish`. If not logged in: `npm login` first. Verify at https://www.npmjs.com/package/@quell/scanner
5. **Clean up** — delete `quell-2.4.0.vsix` from repo root if present (gitignored, no git action needed)

### Post-launch
- Launch post (Product Hunt / HN / LinkedIn/Twitter)
- GitHub Action for automated VSIX release on tag push (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- Monitor adoption numbers, respond to issues
- Explore monetisation surfaces: team pattern packs, CI integration (uses @quell/scanner npm package)
